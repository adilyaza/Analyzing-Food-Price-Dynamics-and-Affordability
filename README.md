# Analyzing Food Price Dynamics and Affordability: 
## A Case Study of the UN World Food Programme Price Monitoring

### Tableau [Dashboards and a Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/UNWFPCaseStudyAnalyzingFoodPriceDynamicsandAffordability/WFPMonitoringDashboard?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  

The project is using the UN WFP [food price database](https://dataviz.vam.wfp.org/) to investigate how price and affordability of staple foods change across countries over time and their relationship with a countryâ€™s economic development, official inflation rate, and food availability. 

Our most recent food price crisis began in February 2022, when Russia initiated a war in Ukraine. With two of the world's largest exporters of wheat and other essential crops involved in conflict, numerous countries, particularly those already vulnerable, now grapple with heightened food insecurity and a rapid surge in food prices. The constant topic of conversation these days is the rising cost of food.

This project seeks to provide a broader perspective on this pressing issue by analyzing the dynamics of food prices and affordability across various countries over several years, with a particular focus on the world's most vulnerable regions.
 
Currently, there is no major data provider that routinely measures and collects data on food affordability across various countries. Therefore, this project combines multiple data sources in an attempt to understand the global context of food price dynamics and highlight the major weaknesses in the existing monitoring system.
